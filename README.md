## Dialogues

The folder _Dialogues_ contains both the original dialogues from the linguistic resources that we used (_Original_), and the ones generated by ChatGPT, following 2 different strategies: _One-shot_, where we prompt to generate the full dialogue at once, and _Interactive_, where we instruct the model to act as desired and then collected the dialogue by interacting with it.

## Amazon Mechanical Turk Evaluation

The folder _MTurk_Evaluations_ contains the results of the evaluations provided by AMT workers, where they were asked to provide different scores related to the quality of the dialogue. Both the original, and the ChatGPT dialogues were evaluated.
